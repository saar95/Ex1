This assignment represents an undirectional (positive) weighted graph by 6 classes using Hahsmaps,Queue's and stacks.

2 public classes, 2 private classes and 2 test classes:

##Public classes:
weighted_graph:represents an undirectional (positive) weighted graph with 2 Hashmaps: one for the nodes and the other for the edges.
weighted_graph_algorithms: represents simple methods that can be used on an undirectional (positive) weighted graph using Hahsmaps,Queue's and stacks.

##Private classes:
node_info:represents vertex with key as a "name" to fill up our graph data structures.
edge:represents the weight of the edges between the vertices(nodes) using hahsmap

##Test classes:
WGraph_DSTest2:test all the weighted_graph methods
WGraph_AlgoTest2: Test all the weighted_graph_algorithms methods

##How to use?
To use my weighted graph data structure you need to use WGraph_DS constructor to build a graph
and use weighted graph methods to fill and connect between nodes.
If you wish to use weighted graph algorithms methods you just need to use WGraph_Algo constructor and simply inhit your weighted graph.
